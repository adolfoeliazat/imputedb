\section{Examples}

Consider the case of an analyst looking to explore the sources and causes of
polling error in a presidential election. One hypothesis \cite{zukin2015s}
is that the rapid switch from landlines to cellphones has increased the
difficulty of contacting potential poll respondents. The analyst may
begin her analysis by comparing the polling error in a state with the
distribution of households with landlines, for the set of states for which
polling error was most pronounced. In order to probe deeply, the analyst
accesses a household-level survey of household characteristics that includes
whether the household has a landline. One such survey --- which will be
discussed further (Sec~\ref{subsec:datasets}) --- is the American Community Survey (ACS),
conducted by the US Census Bureau.

Surveys are rife with missing values due to non-response and other issues, and
the ACS is no exception. In this case, a non-negligible fraction of respondents omitted
information on whether they have a landline. The analyst hypothesizes that older houses are
more likely to have landlines and that households that are relatively new are less likely to
have landlines. 

The analyst could take advantage of these presumed correlations to impute the missing values
in an expensive operation\footnote{One would not necessarily want to impute the entire
database once and store the imputed values, as in many settings the imputation strategy
would be targeted for a specific question or domain.}. On the other hand, the query
could be run directly and rows with missing values would be dropped entirely. With
ImputeDB, the analyst could impute the relevant subset of data on-the-fly, achieving
better performance without losing the information in the dropped examples.

The analyst submits a query to ImputeDB which finds an optimized query plan. The resulting
query imputes missing values for \verb!acs.TEL! after states with high polling error have
been selected.

\begin{verbatim}
SELECT polling.ST, AVG(acs.TEL)
FROM polling, acs
WHERE polling.ST = acs.ST
  AND polling.ERROR > 50         -- 5 percentage points
GROUP BY polling.ST
\end{verbatim}
