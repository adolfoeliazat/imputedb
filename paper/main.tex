\begin{abstract}
In order to study the placement of an imputation step, we create a logical imputation operator (along with respective physical instances) and incorporate its placement as part of the query plan optimization process in SimpleDB.  We introduce measures of uncertainty and completeness of query results as well as the cost of imputation, which outline the main trade-offs in the imputation placement. We add these measures into our cost estimation, allowing us to intelligently place the data imputation step during query planning. We show the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy for simple data imputation models. \end{abstract}
