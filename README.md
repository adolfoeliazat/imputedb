# ImputeDB #

ImputeDB is a SQL database which automatically imputes missing data on-the-fly.
Users can issue SQL queries over data with NULL values and ImputeDB will use a regression model to fill in the missing values during the execution of the query.
Designed to enable exploratory analysis of survey data, ImputeDB removes the cost of performing imputation manually, allowing users to get a quick and accurate view of their data.
